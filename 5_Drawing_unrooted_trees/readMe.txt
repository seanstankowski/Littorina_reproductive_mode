The file 'Newick_analysis_new.txt' contains code for extracting trees from twisst output and plotting them in various ways. This code was used to produce Fig. 3D and fig. S25. The user can provide a list of tree IDs from the twisst output that are of interest, and use a bash loop to extract the subset of trees into a new file. Code is provided to control the R package ggtree so that many trees can be drawn with the same branch coloring and labeling.
