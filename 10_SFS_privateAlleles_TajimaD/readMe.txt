This folder contains code used to calculate the folded site-frequency spectrum, estimate the fraction of alleles that are private to each group, and calculate Tajima's D.

SFS_pvtAlleles_TajimaD.ipynb:
This Jupyter notebook contains custom code used to to calculate the folded site-frequency spectrum, estimate the fraction of alleles that are private to each group, and calculate Tajima's D. This includes code produce Fig. S30, Fig. S31, and Table S10. 

012_For_R_analysis:
This file contains all of the variant and invariant position that are in genomic regions where TR = 1, in 012 format, produced by using the --012 command in VCFtools. Columns are individuals (SP = Iberian sax; N = northern sax, ARC = arcana, C = compress), and rows are markers. This file is used by SFS_pvtAlleles_TajimaD.ipynb.
